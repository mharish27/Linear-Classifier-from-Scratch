# Linear-Classifier-from-Scratch

In this Assignment I have developer a linear classifier for the MNIST digit classification dataset. mathematically I have built a model `y_i = \arg \max f_i(x)`. 
I have used a quadratic loss function for calculating the error and minibatch stochastic gradient descent for training the model.

<h2>Results</h2>

```
Accuracy of the model(iterations = 1000 , batchSize = 100 , lr = 0.01 ) = 0.6775
Accuracy of the model(iterations = 1000 , batchSize = 100 , lr = 0.01 ) = 0.8127
Accuracy of the model(iterations = 1000 , batchSize = 100 , lr = 0.01 ) = 0.8244
Accuracy of the model(iterations = 1000 , batchSize = 100 , lr = 0.01 ) = 0.8556
```
